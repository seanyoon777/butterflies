# butterflies (2021.05.20 V1 by Seonghyun Yoon)

This is an artwork of animated butterfly flight that is both aesthetically pleasing and computationally light. (That is, it does not require the Navier-Stokes equations). 
It has been heavily influeced by artist Aaron penne's "animated butterflies."
The code uses Mathematica, and due to the long codes I have seperated them into many files, where the annotations for each are in the file descriptions.  
Execute in the order of the number at the start of the file name, as some of the variables are used across the files. 

Enjoy!
